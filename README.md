The mobile application was developed using Android Studio (version 4.1.2), so it can be used by Android 
users with an API level of 16 to 29 (Android 10). It is a simple user-friendly app that helps associate the 
information with real images, that can be selected by the user from their gallery, or use the camera to take an 
instant picture of the place they want. The prototype gives a maximum of 10 pages to insert 
an image and the information when a room is created.
